# JOIN Queries for ALX Airbnb Database

## Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins

This task demonstrates three types of SQL joins:

1. **INNER JOIN** - To list all bookings with the users who made them.
2. **LEFT JOIN** - To show all properties along with any reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN** - To retrieve all users and bookings, whether matched or not.

All queries are stored in `joins_queries.sql`.

## Task 1: Practice Subqueries

This task demonstrates usage of both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.

- Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0.
- Find users who have made more than 3 bookings.
